![Java Swing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java_Swing-%23E76F00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)

Worked with four awesome teammates to create a recipe generating application that focuses on using about to expire ingredients. The project focused on clean architecture coding and object-oriented design.I added features for searching recipes and adding ingredients using Java and Maven. Hooked up three REST APIs to fetch recipes and show nutritional info, making the app super user-friendly. I designed over 20% of the app's windows with Java Swing. We utilized JUnit for testing and Git for version control to keep everything organized and on track!

![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenCV-%23white.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=opencv&logoColor=white&color=blue)

Applied numerical techniques in image processing to enhance and transform images. Implemented Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to filter noise and improve clarity, and utilized Gaussian blur for smoothing. Designed solutions for medical imaging noise reduction and edge enhancement in astronomy visuals, leveraging Python libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and OpenCV. This project combined advanced numerical methods with practical image processing applications to achieve precise and efficient results.
