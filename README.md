    <summary><b> 
    🎮 Game Strategy Optimization Tool </b>
    </summary>
This project is a full-stack analytics platform for Teamfight Tactics, featuring a Flask REST API backend and a ReactJS frontend. It uses graph algorithms to analyze player match history and identify optimal     unit combinations and trait synergies, providing personalized insights and recommendations. The platform automates deployment on a Linux environment using Bash scripts to set up dependencies, configure     PostgreSQL, and deploy the application, reducing manual effort by 40%. A SQL database is used to store and query player performance data efficiently, ensuring accurate insights for users.

### How It Looks

When rendered on GitHub, the sections with `<details>` tags will display as a clickable summary bar, and clicking on the bar will expand or collapse the section.

---

### Example of Rendered Markdown

- By default, only the summary line (like "⭐ Personal Projects") is visible.
- Clicking the bar will reveal the content below it.

Let me know if you need additional tweaks or examples!
