### How It Looks

When rendered on GitHub, the sections with `<details>` tags will display as a clickable summary bar, and clicking on the bar will expand or collapse the section.

---

### Example of Rendered Markdown

- By default, only the summary line (like "‚≠ê Personal Projects") is visible.
- Clicking the bar will reveal the content below it.

Let me know if you need additional tweaks or examples!
